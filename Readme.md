# SocketMQ

Bring your ZeroMQ messaging flows into the wild for clients that support Socket.IO

## Introduction

ZeroMQ has introduced a completely new way for how we can exchange messages and resolve different messaging related problems in a much simpler and elegant approach. But it's limited in your internal trusted network. 

Why not to make it avaliable for all the devices/members of your entire messaging process?

By combining ZeroMQ and Socket.IO the two great libs together, SocketMQ simply makes the ZeroMQ semantics avaliable for much boarder clients which support Socket.IO.

You can build application in same sets of messaging semantics/patterns end to end. Thus make your event-driven realtime architecture much easier to implement.
